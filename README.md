Chipkit Uno32 control program for the TenTec Rebel Radio
The program has many comments describing the features but the highlights are:
Nokia Display or operation without a display using the LED's for frequency display.
Keyer, messages, memory tuning,  etc.
Many modes - cw, rtty, mfsk, psk31, wspr, Hellschreiber, etc
Choice of TenTec Argonaut V or Elecraft K3 emulation for use with Ham Radio Deluxe type of programs.
